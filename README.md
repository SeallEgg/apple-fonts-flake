# apple-fonts-flake
Flake providing packages for Apple San Francisco, New York and Apple Color Emoji fonts.
The emoji font is sourced from  are sourced from [samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux) and the other fonts are grabbed from [Apple's own website](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
Enable them with `fonts.apple-fonts.enable = true;`

This is my first flake and any feedback is welcomed!
